Now that we have a working database,

0:00:02.200,0:00:04.780
let's create our first[br]web server in Python.

0:00:04.780,0:00:06.270
Once our web server is up and running,

0:00:06.270,0:00:09.340
let's use the CRUD commands from lesson[br]one to access, our data from a Web page.

0:00:09.340,0:00:11.670
There will be some opportunities[br]in this lesson for

0:00:11.670,0:00:13.860
you to try coding a few[br]things on your own.

0:00:13.860,0:00:16.750
Set aside, some extra time to[br]work through these challenges.

0:00:16.750,0:00:19.605
But before we get started coding,[br]let's review some of the basics of

0:00:19.605,0:00:21.620
client/server communications[br]across the Internet.
