In order to complete this challenge,[br]I will take advantage of the for

0:00:02.830,0:00:04.420
loop I've already created.

0:00:04.420,0:00:08.320
Within it, I will add an anchor tag to[br]edit and delete each restaurant like so.

0:00:08.320,0:00:11.580
I will leave the hrefs empty[br]with hashtags for now,

0:00:11.580,0:00:15.125
since I'll be adding the edit and delete[br]functionality in later objectives.

0:00:15.125,0:00:18.585
I rerun my server again, and[br]get a restaurants page with Edit and

0:00:18.585,0:00:20.555
Delete options for each restaurant.

0:00:20.555,0:00:22.485
Objective two is in the bag.

0:00:22.485,0:00:25.675
The source code for objective two is[br]available in the instructor notes.
