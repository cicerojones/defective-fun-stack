The main concept of HTTP is that[br]clients tell servers what they

0:00:04.370,0:00:08.650
want by using an HTTP verb,[br]also know as an HTTP method.

0:00:08.650,0:00:12.970
There are nine HTTP verbs in[br]the current HTTP specification.

0:00:12.970,0:00:17.340
The two most commonly used methods for[br]websites though, are GET and POST.

0:00:17.340,0:00:20.290
A GET request can be thought of[br]as the client telling the server,

0:00:20.290,0:00:22.260
get me some information that you have.

0:00:22.260,0:00:24.580
Or, a POST can be thought[br]of as the client saying,

0:00:24.580,0:00:27.160
I want to modify some[br]information that you have.

0:00:27.160,0:00:29.590
GETs are sometimes called safe methods,

0:00:29.590,0:00:32.795
since they are only used to retrieve[br]existing data from the database,

0:00:32.795,0:00:37.720
whereas POSTs call for data to be added,[br]removed, or changed on a server.

0:00:37.720,0:00:42.050
We know that the client prefixes[br]requests to the server with HTTP verbs.

0:00:42.050,0:00:43.730
So, how does the server reply?

0:00:43.730,0:00:46.650
Status codes are the server's[br]reply to a client as to

0:00:46.650,0:00:48.910
what happened after a specific request.

0:00:48.910,0:00:50.550
In addition to a status code,

0:00:50.550,0:00:54.380
a server can also supply any requested[br]resources the client requested,

0:00:54.380,0:01:00.270
such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and[br]media files such as images and audio.

0:01:00.270,0:01:04.420
Some common response codes are 200,[br]which indicates a successful GET

0:01:04.420,0:01:10.430
request, 301, which is a successful[br]post request, and 404, which indicates

0:01:10.430,0:01:14.170
that we were looking for a file on the[br]server, and the server couldn't find it.

0:01:14.170,0:01:17.100
In the next section, we'll put all[br]of these concepts together as we

0:01:17.100,0:01:18.710
create our own web server in Python.
