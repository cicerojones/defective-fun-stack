I want to provide you some hints as to[br]how to go about restructuring this code.

0:00:04.310,0:00:07.670
You have already seen all the code[br]necessary to complete this challenge.

0:00:07.670,0:00:10.020
All of the CRUD operations from[br]lesson one will come in handy here.

0:00:10.020,0:00:13.411
You will have to import the modules[br]you used to do your CRUD commands in

0:00:13.411,0:00:14.061
lesson one.

0:00:14.061,0:00:14.913
Alll of the code for

0:00:14.913,0:00:18.560
these objectives can be written[br]within your web server.pi file.

0:00:18.560,0:00:21.930
You'll need to reconstruct your do_GET[br]and do_POST methods, such that they

0:00:21.930,0:00:25.980
perform the necessary CRUD operations[br]to create the desired functionality.

0:00:25.980,0:00:28.770
Print statements are simple ways to[br]see if our code is flowing the way

0:00:28.770,0:00:29.710
we expect.

0:00:29.710,0:00:33.030
Feel free to use print statements to[br]see what blocks your code is in, and

0:00:33.030,0:00:34.170
the value of variables,

0:00:34.170,0:00:37.570
like I did with the output variable[br]that showed our HTML code.

0:00:37.570,0:00:41.010
Within your browser, you can view source[br]code, as well as inspect DOM elements,

0:00:41.010,0:00:44.670
to see if you are outputting the HTML[br]you expect to see from your server code.
