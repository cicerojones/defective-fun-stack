I will solve objective[br]three in this next video,

0:00:02.009,0:00:07.273
by creating a webpage when the user[br]visits localhost:/8080/restaurants/new.

0:00:07.273,0:00:09.900
This page will contain a form[br]that a user can fill out

0:00:09.900,0:00:11.370
to create a new restaurant.

0:00:11.370,0:00:13.790
The form will then send a post[br]request to the server, and

0:00:13.790,0:00:16.020
create a new restaurant[br]entry in the database.

0:00:16.020,0:00:18.590
Once you've attempted this challenge,[br]proceed to the solution video.
