We have a server that can say hello, so

0:00:02.090,0:00:04.220
now let's add some more[br]functionality to it.

0:00:04.220,0:00:06.840
Most modern websites have[br]more than just one page, so

0:00:06.840,0:00:09.280
let's figure out how to add[br]this feature to our web server.

0:00:09.280,0:00:11.770
In this section we will see that our[br]server can handle different types of

0:00:11.770,0:00:14.990
GET requests, and respond with[br]different types of messages.

0:00:14.990,0:00:16.590
Instead of replying with hello,

0:00:16.590,0:00:20.110
let's make a page that also replies in[br]Spanish when we visit the hola URL.

0:00:21.470,0:00:24.280
I'm going to copy my if block[br]from before and paste it below.

0:00:24.280,0:00:27.020
I will change the message[br]that said hello in English,

0:00:27.020,0:00:30.480
to hola in Spanish,[br]using this special entity code that

0:00:30.480,0:00:33.820
HTML will render as[br]an upside-down exclamation point.

0:00:33.820,0:00:37.340
I will also add an anchor tag to link[br]back to my original hello page, just so

0:00:37.340,0:00:39.010
we can see how that's done here.

0:00:39.010,0:00:41.050
Now, I'm ready to try and[br]run this and see what happens.
