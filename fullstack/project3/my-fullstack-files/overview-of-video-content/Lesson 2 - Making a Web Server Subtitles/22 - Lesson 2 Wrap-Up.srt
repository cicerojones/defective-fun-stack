Great job on finishing lesson two.

0:00:02.340,0:00:04.880
At this rate,[br]you'll be a professional in no time.

0:00:04.880,0:00:08.600
In this lesson, you created a web[br]server in Python, learned what GET and

0:00:08.600,0:00:11.720
POST requests are and[br]how to create code to handle them, and

0:00:11.720,0:00:15.260
implemented all CRUD operations[br]via web pages and forms.

0:00:15.260,0:00:17.500
So, now you've learned the basic[br]underlying concepts of

0:00:17.500,0:00:20.460
creating a data-driven web[br]app using just Python.

0:00:20.460,0:00:23.410
In lesson three, you'll be developing[br]a new web server, but this time,

0:00:23.410,0:00:25.370
using a framework to help[br]you code more efficiently.
