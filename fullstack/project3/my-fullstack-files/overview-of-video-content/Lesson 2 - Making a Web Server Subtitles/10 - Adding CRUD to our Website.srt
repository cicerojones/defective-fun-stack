Great job on creating your hello server.

0:00:02.450,0:00:04.440
Now that we have a working web server,

0:00:04.440,0:00:07.290
let's see if we can add some[br]CRUD operations to our site.

0:00:07.290,0:00:10.180
This will be a fun activity, where[br]you'll finally bring together all of

0:00:10.180,0:00:13.540
the major aspects you've learned[br]about creating data-driven websites.

0:00:13.540,0:00:16.700
In this next section, you are going[br]to modify our web server code,

0:00:16.700,0:00:20.190
such that we can create,[br]read, update, and

0:00:20.190,0:00:22.900
delete restaurants from our[br]restaurant menu database.

0:00:22.900,0:00:25.490
I will be adding these features[br]in the next five sections,

0:00:25.490,0:00:27.190
divided up into objectives.

0:00:27.190,0:00:29.900
I highly encourage you to read through[br]the objective's descriptions that I'll

0:00:29.900,0:00:31.380
be presenting in a moment, and

0:00:31.380,0:00:33.500
attempt to solve them before[br]seeing the solution videos.

0:00:34.680,0:00:36.820
Up until now,[br]we've been moving pretty quickly.

0:00:36.820,0:00:38.660
But this is an opportunity to slow down,[br]and

0:00:38.660,0:00:40.940
get messy,[br]figuring out these challenges.

0:00:40.940,0:00:43.840
I'll be sharing my answers with you,[br]but through this process you

0:00:43.840,0:00:46.610
might even create more elegant[br]solutions than my own.

0:00:46.610,0:00:47.930
Before we get started coding,

0:00:47.930,0:00:50.980
let me list off the objectives I[br]want to complete for this project.

0:00:50.980,0:00:54.460
Listing objectives helps me to[br]understand the scope of my project and

0:00:54.460,0:00:56.920
create identifiable[br]milestones along the way.

0:00:56.920,0:00:59.550
These objectives should also serve[br]as guidelines you should follow to

0:00:59.550,0:01:01.110
complete this project.

0:01:01.110,0:01:03.870
The goal of objective one is to[br]modify the webserver.py file,

0:01:03.870,0:01:07.230
so that opening local hosts or[br]8080/restaurants,

0:01:07.230,0:01:11.180
the user sees a list of all[br]the restaurant names in the database.

0:01:11.180,0:01:13.940
To complete objective two,[br]after the name of each restaurant,

0:01:13.940,0:01:16.680
there should be a link to edit and[br]delete each restaurant.

0:01:16.680,0:01:18.400
These links don't have to work for now.

0:01:18.400,0:01:19.800
They should just be visible.

0:01:19.800,0:01:22.930
The third objective goal is to add[br]code such that there is a page to

0:01:22.930,0:01:26.850
create new restaurants, with a form for[br]writing the new restaurant name.

0:01:26.850,0:01:30.350
The form should create a post request[br]that creates a new restaurant menu item

0:01:30.350,0:01:31.610
in the database.

0:01:31.610,0:01:35.270
To complete objective four, we enhance[br]the web server such that users can

0:01:35.270,0:01:39.560
rename a restaurant and persist[br]this edit to the database via post.

0:01:39.560,0:01:41.580
And the last objective[br]creates a feature,

0:01:41.580,0:01:45.280
such that by clicking Delete,[br]takes the user to a confirmation page.

0:01:45.280,0:01:46.540
That then sends a post command to

0:01:46.540,0:01:49.370
the database to delete[br]the selected restaurant.

0:01:49.370,0:01:52.840
If you don't get it on the first attempt[br]or have to spend some time debugging or

0:01:52.840,0:01:55.090
looking things up online, that's okay.

0:01:55.090,0:01:57.450
Even the best of programmers[br]have to debug code.

0:01:57.450,0:02:00.800
Try to spend about three hours working[br]on each of the objectives before viewing

0:02:00.800,0:02:03.670
the solutions if you're still[br]relatively new to programming.

0:02:03.670,0:02:06.900
Don't forget to use your resources[br]like the Python documentation, and

0:02:06.900,0:02:10.520
tools like the source code inspector in[br]Chrome to help you debug your program,

0:02:10.520,0:02:12.870
and don't hesitate to ask[br]questions in the forum.

0:02:12.870,0:02:15.690
I'll be going over the solution[br]to this challenge piece by piece,

0:02:15.690,0:02:18.980
solving each objective in order,[br]once you're finished with an object,

0:02:18.980,0:02:21.900
continue to the next video to see[br]my implementation of the solution.
