0:00:00.170,0:00:02.100
We specified id as an integer.

0:00:02.100,0:00:05.350
So, in our mapper we should[br]also specify the same thing.

0:00:05.350,0:00:09.220
So, we have this ForeignKey relationship[br]between our address and our employee.

0:00:09.220,0:00:12.260
So here,[br]in this lower case employee variable,

0:00:12.260,0:00:15.070
we set its relationship to the actual[br]employee class we created.
