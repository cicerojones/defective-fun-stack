Let's create a web application that[br]allows us to create multiple restaurant

0:00:03.420,0:00:06.150
menus without having to[br]change the source code.

0:00:06.150,0:00:10.170
We want to be able to create menu items,[br]read the items we've created,

0:00:10.170,0:00:12.830
update our menu items, and[br]delete items from time to time.

0:00:14.570,0:00:16.610
Hm, sounds like we[br]need to make some CRUD.

0:00:16.610,0:00:18.550
What's so special about CRUD, you ask?

0:00:18.550,0:00:21.980
Well, this four letter acronym[br]encapsulates all of the actions a user

0:00:21.980,0:00:23.950
does on a data-driven website.

0:00:23.950,0:00:28.430
Each time we make a new profile, post[br]a new status, write a new blog entry,

0:00:28.430,0:00:31.270
upload a new pic, or[br]add a new item to a menu,

0:00:31.270,0:00:34.130
we are creating new data to[br]be stored in our database.

0:00:34.130,0:00:36.640
Whenever we look through a friend's[br]latest tweets and pics, or

0:00:36.640,0:00:37.890
skim through our news feed,

0:00:37.890,0:00:41.230
we are reading data that was already[br]stored in an application's database.

0:00:41.230,0:00:43.920
When we correct the typo on[br]a blog post we already made,

0:00:43.920,0:00:47.840
modify the item quantity in our shopping[br]cart, or change our profile information,

0:00:47.840,0:00:51.160
we are performing an update on[br]existing information in the database.

0:00:51.160,0:00:54.510
And when it's time to erase that[br]embarrassing baby pic from our profile

0:00:54.510,0:00:56.470
or get rid of those items[br]in our shopping cart,

0:00:56.470,0:00:59.230
we're deleting information[br]in the database.

0:00:59.230,0:01:02.070
Virtually everything we do on the web[br]can be summarized with one little

0:01:02.070,0:01:03.160
acronym, CRUD.

0:01:03.160,0:01:06.590
I want you to take a look at[br]a few common website actions and

0:01:06.590,0:01:08.150
then decide what the CRUD is going on.
