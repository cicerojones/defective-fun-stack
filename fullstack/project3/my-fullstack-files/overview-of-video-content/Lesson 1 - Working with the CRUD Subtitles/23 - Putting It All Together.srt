0:00:00.522,0:00:02.610
So we've gone through[br]a fair amount of code.

0:00:02.610,0:00:06.220
Let's go ahead, and put it all together[br]in our database_setup.py file.

0:00:06.220,0:00:08.800
Let me start with this[br]configuration code that goes at

0:00:08.800,0:00:11.610
the beginning of our file,[br]and put it where it belongs.

0:00:11.610,0:00:15.060
I can also take this code at the end,[br]and put it at the end of the file.

0:00:15.060,0:00:18.360
Next, let's put our two class[br]definitions, right where they belong.

0:00:18.360,0:00:20.456
Next, we need to add[br]our table information.

0:00:20.456,0:00:24.180
And finally, our mappers.

0:00:24.180,0:00:25.530
Putting all this code together,

0:00:25.530,0:00:28.710
should give us a Python file[br]that looks something like this.

0:00:28.710,0:00:32.530
So, if we navigate to the directory,[br]where our database_setup.py file live,

0:00:32.530,0:00:36.785
and run it using the Python command,[br]we should get something like this.

0:00:36.785,0:00:37.725
Looking in the same folder,

0:00:37.725,0:00:41.625
where we have our code,[br]we see a newrestaurantmenu.db file.

0:00:41.625,0:00:43.365
This is our empty database.

0:00:43.365,0:00:45.015
Now that we have an empty database,

0:00:45.015,0:00:47.015
let's figure out how to populate[br]it with some information.
