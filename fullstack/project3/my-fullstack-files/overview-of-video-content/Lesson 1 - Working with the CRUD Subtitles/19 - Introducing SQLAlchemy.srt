When I Google search ORM for[br]Python I get over 14

0:00:03.410,0:00:06.670
million results with several[br]different ORM options we could use.

0:00:06.670,0:00:09.320
The first result that showed[br]up when I searched was for

0:00:09.320,0:00:11.910
an application called SQL Alchemy.

0:00:11.910,0:00:15.820
SQL Alchemy is an open source ORM for[br]Python with a slew of features.

Not to mention this awesome[br]Getting Started tutorial.

There's a lot of[br]information on this page.

0:00:20.230,0:00:23.610
But let's just focus on setting up[br]our database and tables for now.

0:00:23.610,0:00:25.480
If you're using the Vagrantfile,

0:00:25.480,0:00:28.620
SQLAlchemy is already installed[br]on your virtual machine.

0:00:28.620,0:00:30.050
If you are not using Vagrant,

0:00:30.050,0:00:32.970
you can install SQLAlchemy from[br]the link below to follow along.
