0:00:00.090,0:00:02.200
So in order to create the new[br]entry in our database,

0:00:02.200,0:00:05.590
we have to specify the name[br]variable as Rebecca Allen.

0:00:05.590,0:00:09.299
We also need to create the ForeignKey[br]relationship between Rebecca's address

0:00:09.299,0:00:12.470
and the new employee variable that[br]we created in the previous line.
