Our class code is the object-oriented[br]representation of a table in

0:00:03.990,0:00:05.120
our database.

0:00:05.120,0:00:07.930
The only thing we need to do[br]is create a class name, and

0:00:07.930,0:00:10.610
make it extend from the Base[br]class we just created.

0:00:10.610,0:00:14.040
For conventional purposes,[br]let's make all of our classes start with

0:00:14.040,0:00:18.540
a capital letter with no spaces in[br]between, also called camo casing.

0:00:18.540,0:00:21.690
Inside of this class declaration,[br]we will add all of the code for

0:00:21.690,0:00:23.800
our table and mapper code.

0:00:23.800,0:00:27.280
For this project, we will need to[br]create two classes to correspond with

0:00:27.280,0:00:31.360
the two tables we want to create in our[br]database, restaurant and menu item.

0:00:31.360,0:00:34.320
Be sure to write this class[br]code between your beginning and

0:00:34.320,0:00:36.160
ending configuration code.

0:00:36.160,0:00:39.540
Inside each of our classes,[br]we must create a table representation,

0:00:39.540,0:00:43.810
we use the special variable, double[br]underscore table name double underscore.

0:00:43.810,0:00:48.100
To let SQLAlchemy know the variable[br]that we will use to refer to our table.

0:00:48.100,0:00:51.450
For conventional purposes,[br]let's make our table names lowercase,

0:00:51.450,0:00:53.190
with underscores for spaces.

0:00:53.190,0:00:56.800
Inside our restaurant class, we will[br]set double underscore tablename double

0:00:56.800,0:01:00.820
underscore equal to restaurant,[br]and inside the MenuItem class we

0:01:00.820,0:01:03.990
will set it equal to menu[br]underscore item, as seen here.
