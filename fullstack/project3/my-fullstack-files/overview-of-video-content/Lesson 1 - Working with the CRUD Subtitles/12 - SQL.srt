So we know that web application[br]code gets the information that it

0:00:03.160,0:00:06.870
needs to create websites by performing[br]CRUD operations on the database.

0:00:06.870,0:00:10.390
But how do we get an application and a[br]database to communicate with each other?

0:00:10.390,0:00:12.690
You already know that SQL[br]is the popular language for

0:00:12.690,0:00:14.420
communicating with databases.

0:00:14.420,0:00:17.570
From our application code,[br]we can create SQL commands and

0:00:17.570,0:00:20.140
decipher the results to integrate[br]back into our application.
