Happy birthday!

0:00:01.880,0:00:04.490
The zoo has some new-born baby possums.

0:00:04.490,0:00:06.380
Let's add them to the database.

0:00:06.380,0:00:10.140
To do that, we need a different SQL[br]statement, the insert statement.

0:00:10.140,0:00:12.120
Insert adds a row to a table.

0:00:12.120,0:00:14.870
When you write an insert,[br]you tell the database,

0:00:14.870,0:00:17.880
what values to put into[br]the columns of that table.

0:00:17.880,0:00:21.650
If the new values aren't in the same[br]order, as the table's columns,.

0:00:21.650,0:00:24.540
Then you also have to tell it[br]what columns they go into.

0:00:24.540,0:00:27.880
On the next page,[br]you'll see two queries in the editor.

0:00:27.880,0:00:31.620
One of them is the select query and[br]the other is an insert.

0:00:31.620,0:00:35.610
Your job is to fill in the second query,[br]with the right insert statement.

0:00:35.610,0:00:39.530
When you press the test run or[br]submit button, you'll see the results of

0:00:39.530,0:00:44.790
the select before the insert, and[br]then the results after the insert.

0:00:44.790,0:00:46.130
And here's what we'd like to do.

0:00:46.130,0:00:48.840
Find the opossums that[br]are already in the table, and

0:00:48.840,0:00:50.760
add the newborn opossum to the table.
