0:00:00.300,0:00:01.280
So our first rule for

0:00:01.280,0:00:06.010
our normalized table, will be that every[br]row has the same number of columns.

0:00:06.010,0:00:11.100
A column can be empty or zero, but we[br]can't have two columns in some rows and

0:00:11.100,0:00:12.910
three columns in another row.

0:00:12.910,0:00:16.129
That just doesn't make sense[br]in a relational database.

0:00:16.129,0:00:19.140
In fact, that's pretty much[br]the same thing that's going on,

0:00:19.140,0:00:22.940
when we had the food one,[br]food two, and food three columns.

0:00:22.940,0:00:25.180
If you have two values[br]with the same meaning for

0:00:25.180,0:00:29.582
a given key, they're going to need to[br]end up in separate rows, like this.

0:00:29.582,0:00:34.380
Second rule, some one or[br]more columns of the table are the key,

0:00:34.380,0:00:37.360
which identify what thing[br]each row is telling us about,

0:00:37.360,0:00:42.210
like an animal, a species,[br]a bank account number, a website user.

0:00:42.210,0:00:43.250
In a simple table,

0:00:43.250,0:00:47.640
like majors, it may be that all of[br]the columns are part of the key.

0:00:47.640,0:00:51.390
Any other columns in the table[br]besides the key have to

0:00:51.390,0:00:52.890
describe something about the key.

0:00:53.960,0:00:59.050
In any row, the key provides the topic[br]of the sentence that the rest of

0:00:59.050,0:01:00.290
the row says something about.

0:01:01.820,0:01:06.140
Rule 3, in a normalized table,[br]the non-key columns describe the key.

0:01:06.140,0:01:09.560
They don't describe[br]other non-key columns.

0:01:09.560,0:01:12.780
So if you had a table of items and[br]how many there are, and

0:01:12.780,0:01:16.590
what location their in and[br]the street address of that location.

0:01:16.590,0:01:20.220
To normalize that you don't split[br]out the mapping from location to

0:01:20.220,0:01:24.060
address from the rest of the table,[br]like so.

0:01:24.060,0:01:28.480
That way you can talk about a location[br]without talking about a particular item.

0:01:28.480,0:01:32.760
It's not as if the street address is[br]specific to a particular item after all.

0:01:32.760,0:01:34.990
Lastly, in a normalized table,

0:01:34.990,0:01:39.270
the rows don't imply relationships among[br]the data that don't actually exist.

0:01:39.270,0:01:42.420
This is something to watch out for,[br]especially when you have multiple rows

0:01:42.420,0:01:46.460
about the same entity and multiple[br]facts you want to record about it.

0:01:46.460,0:01:49.530
Suppose that you have some information[br]about some people's work skills,

0:01:49.530,0:01:51.450
including the languages that they know.

0:01:51.450,0:01:54.110
Here Annabel knows Databases and and

0:01:54.110,0:01:58.500
Linux and Data Science, and[br]English, and French and Arabic.

0:01:59.680,0:02:04.340
And Leon knows Data Science and[br]Windows, and English and Kurdish.

0:02:04.340,0:02:07.940
But Databases don't have anything[br]particularly to do with English,

0:02:07.940,0:02:09.919
not Linux with French.

0:02:09.919,0:02:11.980
But these rows make[br]it look like they do.

0:02:11.980,0:02:15.470
They make it look like Annabel's Linux[br]skill has something to

0:02:15.470,0:02:19.260
do with her French language ability,[br]and that's almost certainly wrong.

0:02:19.260,0:02:22.770
So the mapping from people to[br]their technology skills, and

0:02:22.770,0:02:28.240
the mapping of people to the languages[br]they know belong in separate tables.

0:02:28.240,0:02:31.090
So there are four rules for[br]normalizing tables.

0:02:31.090,0:02:33.350
There's a lot more to learn[br]about this topic, though.

0:02:33.350,0:02:35.910
I've put some links in the instructor[br]notes, that you might want to read.
