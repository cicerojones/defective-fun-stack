0:00:00.730,0:00:05.260
The first step in your project should[br]be to think about the database schema.

0:00:05.260,0:00:07.570
Remember to write your[br]create table statements in

0:00:07.570,0:00:09.580
a file called tournament.sql.

0:00:09.580,0:00:14.100
You'll be submitting this along with[br]your code as part of your final project.

0:00:14.100,0:00:17.270
Remember that after you've created your[br]database, if you decide you've made

0:00:17.270,0:00:22.930
a mistake, you can always drop a table,[br]or the whole database and recreate it.

0:00:22.930,0:00:27.140
And if you need to clear out the data[br]in a table, you can use delete.

0:00:27.140,0:00:29.950
Remember that drop table will[br]remove the table completely, and

0:00:29.950,0:00:33.170
you will have to recreate it[br]using the recreate table command.

0:00:33.170,0:00:37.010
Whereas delete from that table[br]will just remove the rows leaving

0:00:37.010,0:00:39.340
the column definitions,[br]constraints, and so forth.

0:00:39.340,0:00:39.840
Intact.

0:00:41.200,0:00:43.230
A few more things to keep in mind.

0:00:43.230,0:00:46.420
When players are added to a tournament[br]the database should assign each

0:00:46.420,0:00:48.460
player a unique ID.

0:00:48.460,0:00:51.460
You've seen how to do that[br]using the serial type.

0:00:51.460,0:00:52.740
There's an extra credit option,

0:00:52.740,0:00:55.620
where you can extend the project[br]to support multiple tournaments.

0:00:55.620,0:00:59.060
If you do that you'll want[br]unique IDs for those too.

0:00:59.060,0:01:02.020
Second, remember that you[br]can use SQL aggregations,

0:01:02.020,0:01:04.360
when you want to count things or[br]add them up.

0:01:04.360,0:01:07.410
If you find yourself pulling lots of[br]rows from the database into your code,

0:01:07.410,0:01:11.740
and then using len to count them,[br]or using a loop to add them up,

0:01:11.740,0:01:14.600
trying doing that in[br]the database query instead.

0:01:14.600,0:01:17.760
Last, if you notice your queries[br]start to get really complicated,

0:01:17.760,0:01:20.060
don't forget about views.

0:01:20.060,0:01:21.820
Views work nicely with aggregations,

0:01:21.820,0:01:24.350
when you want to present[br]summary data quickly.

0:01:24.350,0:01:27.310
If you use views,[br]make sure to put your create view

0:01:27.310,0:01:31.350
statements into tournament.sql,[br]along with your create tables.

0:01:31.350,0:01:34.180
With that, it's time to get into[br]designing your database and

0:01:34.180,0:01:35.270
writing your code.

0:01:35.270,0:01:37.910
On the next page, you'll find a full[br]description of the project, and

0:01:37.910,0:01:39.460
an outline of the functions[br]you'll be writing.
