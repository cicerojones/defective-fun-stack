The more that I think about it, is that all of the values in a row,  are part of the same sentence describing something.  For instance, describing the country of Columbia.  Columbia has a population of 47 million and the literacy rate of 94%.  And all of the values in a column, are ones that have the same role or  place, in different sentences.  So, this number, describes about Brazil,  the same sort of a fact, that this number describes about Colombia.  They're both population figures, but for different countries.
