Now in adapting our form DB[br]code to use a real database,

0:00:03.890,0:00:06.620
you might have written something[br]that looks a lot like this.

0:00:06.620,0:00:11.860
In the get all posts function, you[br]connect to a database, make a cursor,

0:00:11.860,0:00:15.240
execute a SELECT statement,[br]format the results appropriately,

0:00:15.240,0:00:17.400
close the connection return the posts.

0:00:17.400,0:00:21.510
But then to add a post,[br]connect to the database, make a cursor.

0:00:21.510,0:00:26.130
Execute an INSERT that[br]substitutes in the post content,

0:00:26.130,0:00:28.590
commit that to the database and close.

0:00:28.590,0:00:31.080
Now, this looks good,[br]but it isn't quite.

0:00:31.080,0:00:33.700
If you're writing a bunch[br]of different forum app.

0:00:33.700,0:00:37.571
Are there any posts that don't[br]seem to work quite right?

0:00:47.114,0:00:48.250
Say what?

0:00:48.250,0:00:49.440
Wait a minute.

0:00:49.440,0:00:52.180
That looked like a perfectly good post.

0:00:52.180,0:00:54.580
Why are we getting this[br]weird error from it?

0:00:55.670,0:00:57.550
Let's go back to our terminal.

0:00:57.550,0:00:58.230
Oh, look at this.

0:00:58.230,0:01:00.220
We have a trace back from python.

0:01:00.220,0:01:01.680
It says programming error.

0:01:01.680,0:01:03.620
Syntax error at or near t.

0:01:03.620,0:01:07.010
And there's out INSERT statement VALUES.

0:01:07.010,0:01:10.020
I can't find a problem.

0:01:10.020,0:01:11.930
Let's look back at the code.

0:01:11.930,0:01:15.290
So, here's where the post content,[br]gets sent to the database.

0:01:15.290,0:01:17.410
It just gets added into a SQL statement.

0:01:18.570,0:01:20.730
Inside single quotes.

0:01:20.730,0:01:23.870
Because, we put SQL strings[br]inside single quotes.

0:01:23.870,0:01:28.100
But the database, sees the quote from[br]the post, and it thinks that's the end

0:01:28.100,0:01:31.760
of a string, and that t is[br]something it doesn't understand.

0:01:31.760,0:01:34.270
By the way,[br]if your code didn't have this bug,

0:01:34.270,0:01:36.240
congratulations, that's awesome.

0:01:36.240,0:01:39.900
But stay tuned, because there's more[br]to this bug than might first appear.

0:01:39.900,0:01:43.520
Despite the fact that we had a little[br]problem, we can still post things.

0:01:43.520,0:01:45.020
As long as they don't have[br]single quotes in them.

0:01:46.060,0:01:47.050
But here's something to try.

0:01:48.270,0:01:49.280
Single quote.

0:01:49.280,0:01:50.215
Close param.

0:01:50.215,0:01:52.490
Semi colon.

0:01:52.490,0:01:54.720
Don't retype this from what I'm saying.

0:01:54.720,0:01:57.800
Copy it from the instructor notes,[br]and put them into your forum.

0:01:57.800,0:01:59.235
Delete from posts.

0:01:59.235,0:02:01.166
Semi colon.

0:02:01.166,0:02:02.926
Double dash.

0:02:02.926,0:02:05.090
Post this.

0:02:05.090,0:02:07.270
Wait, all, all of our posts are gone.

0:02:07.270,0:02:10.050
I thought we had a database here.

0:02:10.050,0:02:11.170
Hey, wait a minute.

0:02:11.170,0:02:13.790
I thought I saw this one[br]on the webcomic XKCD.

0:02:13.790,0:02:19.590
What we have here is a security hole[br]called an SQL injection attack.

0:02:19.590,0:02:23.610
Some of the post's text is being[br]treated as a database command,

0:02:23.610,0:02:26.500
namely delete from posts.

0:02:26.500,0:02:30.158
Which as it happens, means delete[br]every row from the posts table.

0:02:30.158,0:02:33.220
Well, that stinks.

0:02:33.220,0:02:35.390
All those brilliant test[br]posts we wrote are gone, and

0:02:35.390,0:02:37.060
we have a famous security[br]bug in our code.

0:02:37.060,0:02:40.010
How are we going to fix this?

0:02:40.010,0:02:42.710
Well, we might not be able to get[br]all those great posts back, but

0:02:42.710,0:02:44.850
we should be able to at least[br]keep it from happening again.
