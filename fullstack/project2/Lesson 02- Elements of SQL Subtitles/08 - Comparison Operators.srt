So here is the question you were asked to answer, and  here is one possible answer.  Select name from animals where species equals llama, and  birthdate is greater than or equal to the beginning of 1995, January 1, 1995.  And birthdate is less than or equal to December 31, 1998.  So, just as when you did this manually, your query should have found one llama,  Allison the llama.  Now we can have the database find our llamas for us,  instead of doing it by hand.  This is a pretty big help if we have lots and lots of llamas.
