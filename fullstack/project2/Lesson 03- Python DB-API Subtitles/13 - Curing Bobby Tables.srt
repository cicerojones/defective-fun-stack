The problem with our code is that user[br]input gets put into a database query in

0:00:03.770,0:00:05.270
an unsafe way.

0:00:05.270,0:00:08.020
Some text submitted in the forum[br]ended up being considered as

0:00:08.020,0:00:09.890
SQL code instead of as a text value.

0:00:11.510,0:00:14.320
But there's another way to[br]do our query that's safe.

0:00:14.320,0:00:18.940
When we execute a query,[br]we can put a %s in the query text, and

0:00:18.940,0:00:22.460
then after it,[br]a tuple parameter to the execute call.

0:00:22.460,0:00:26.340
The database library will[br]substitute this into the query in

0:00:26.340,0:00:28.830
a way that's safe so[br]this problem will never happen again.

0:00:29.860,0:00:33.550
Using what you've just learned,[br]you can now update forumdb.py to

0:00:33.550,0:00:37.010
execute insert queries safely[br]using query parameters.

0:00:37.010,0:00:39.940
Test your work by checking that[br]you can now make posts with single

0:00:39.940,0:00:40.950
quotes in them and

0:00:40.950,0:00:45.140
that the SQL injection attack query[br]doesn't delete the whole forum anymore.

0:00:45.140,0:00:48.660
When you're done, press Submit,[br]then Continue to go on.
