Well, now we have fixed our web app so  users can't post JavaScript into it and create endless spam.  But all of that spam is still in the database.  How do we clean it up?  Or for that matter, if some user of our forum posted something awful into it,  how would we get rid of that post?  We have a couple of options here.  First, let's try replacing the spam post to something innocuous like,  say, the word Cheese!  We can do that from the psql database console, but to do it,  we're going to need a new SQL command, the update command.  Update is the SQL command for changing values in existing rows.  Unlike insert, it doesn't create new rows.  Instead, it replaces the value of a named column with a new  value in each row where this restriction is true.  The where restriction on update works like the one on select, but  if you leave it off entirely, the update will apply to every row in the table,  which is usually not what you want.  But you can always do a select first with that restriction to make sure that  your update affects the right rows.  But how are we going to find the right posts?  It would be a big pain to have to type out the whole spam post contents so  we can match it with the equals operator.  Here's a more fitting operator, the like operator.  Like takes a value, usually a text column,  on the left side and a pattern on the right.  And just because you really needed one more meaning for  the percent sign, SQL patterns use it to mean any string can go here.  So, now in the psql console, use the update command to replace all  the horrible spam posts in your database with something innocuous like cheese.  To check your work, reload the forum page or do select star from  posts in psql and check that all the spam has been replaced.
