Congratulations, you've reached the end of this introduction to  relational databases.  You now know the basic operations of SQL and elementary database design, and  you've beaten some of the biggest bugs in the area of database backed websites.  Relational databases are a big field and  there are a lot of next steps you can take.  If you're into math, you might want to look into the relational algebra.  If you are more interested in production systems, there's a lot to be  learned about building bigger and more reliable databases.  If you are looking to learn more about database baked web applications in  Python, we have some other awesome courses that you could check out next.  I put some links to them in the instructor notes below.  I hope you enjoyed this course, see you around.
