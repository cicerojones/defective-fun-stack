So, the question was in the Swiss system, if there are 16 players,  how many rounds does it take to find a champion, and  how many total matches will be played?  Even though players aren't eliminated from the tournament by losing a match,  one loss means they can't become the unbeaten champion.  In fact, if we look at this subgraph, of this Swiss system tournament,  it looks an awful lot like this elimination tournament.  This means that the Swiss tournament takes the same number of rounds,  as the elimination tournament to find a champion.  So if there are 16 players, it would take four rounds.  In the total number of matches, it's just the number of rounds multiplied by  the pairs of players in each graph.  Since no players are eliminated, each of the 16 players are in each round.   multiplying this by four rounds, tells us there are 32 total matches played.
