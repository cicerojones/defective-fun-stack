For the final project in this course,[br]you're going to build databased backed

0:00:03.590,0:00:06.740
software to run a particular kind[br]of game or sporting tournament.

0:00:08.560,0:00:12.220
In a Swiss style game tournament,[br]players aren't eliminated when they

0:00:12.220,0:00:15.390
lose a match, every player,[br]gets to play in every round.

0:00:16.750,0:00:19.590
And in each round,[br]each player plays against someone with

0:00:19.590,0:00:23.660
about the same number of wins and losses[br]that they have, which means that each

0:00:23.660,0:00:27.720
player is likely to be matched against[br]an opponent with about equal strength.

0:00:27.720,0:00:31.890
Ties are broken by looking at how well[br]the tied players' opponents have done.

0:00:31.890,0:00:34.280
After all beating two[br]strong opponents counts for

0:00:34.280,0:00:35.940
more than beating two weak opponents.

0:00:36.980,0:00:41.880
This system was invented in Zurich,[br]Switzerland in 1895 for chess.

0:00:41.880,0:00:46.170
But it is now used for a wide variety[br]of games and sports around the world.

0:00:46.170,0:00:49.650
And keeping track of such a complicated[br]tournament is a good job for a database.

0:00:50.650,0:00:51.380
In this lesson,

0:00:51.380,0:00:54.760
you'll be writing a python module[br]that uses the PSQL database,

0:00:54.760,0:00:58.830
to pair up players in each round of[br]a tournament and record their results.
