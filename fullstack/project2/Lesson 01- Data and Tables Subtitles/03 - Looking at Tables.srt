In a relational database, we store all our data in the form of tables.  So, here's a table with some data in it.  You probably already know how to answer a lot of questions using data  and tables.  Database tables aren't all that different from tables you might find in  an infographic or reference book.  Looking at a table like this, you can tell things like,  say, the population of Brazil or the literacy rate in Argentina.  So, even before we get into databases in any kind of detail,  you can probably already answer some questions about how tables work.  Don't worry about getting these questions right or  wrong, but take a moment to think about your answers before we go on.  So first, when we look across a row like this one,  what do these values have in common?  And second, when we look down a column like this one,  what do the values there have in common?
