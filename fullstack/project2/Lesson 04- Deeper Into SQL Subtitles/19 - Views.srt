You've probably noticed that SQL queries can get pretty complicated once  the clauses and sub-queries start to stack up.  As programmers, when we're writing code and a function starts to  get too complex, we look for ways to re-factor it into smaller functions.  Well we can do that in SQL too.  Every select query returns a table.  So, we can have the database remember a select query for us, and  make it available to later queries.  When we do this, it's called a view.  Here's the syntax for the create view command.  Views are really useful with aggregations like counts or sums.  For instance, if we have a table of students enrolled in courses, and  we want to know how many students are in each course,  we can find that out with an aggregation.  But then if we're going to use that query a lot, we can store it in a view.  Using a view instead of making a subquery,  is kind of like using a function call instead of copying code.  Another use of views is to display only particular columns,  from a table that has a lot of columns.  If you have a table with 20 columns, and you have a lot of queries that only  refer to four of them, making a view can make your code a lot more clear.  Here's something to think about.  Do you think that a database system like PostgreSQL, should let us update and  delete rows in a view?
