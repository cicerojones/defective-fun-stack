0:00:00.340,0:00:03.820
Okay, so here I am, at the original[br]design of the class Movie,

0:00:03.820,0:00:06.730
to figure out the next thing[br]we have to do with our code.

0:00:06.730,0:00:09.860
So thus far, what we have done[br]is define the class Movie and

0:00:09.860,0:00:13.160
taken care of all of the instance[br]variables we want to remember.

0:00:13.160,0:00:16.180
We also designed a couple of[br]instances of the class Movie,

0:00:16.180,0:00:18.450
namely Toy Story and Avatar.

0:00:18.450,0:00:23.540
The one thing we still haven't done is[br]define this function show_trailer().

0:00:23.540,0:00:27.640
Now, this function as its name suggests,[br]will open a browser and

0:00:27.640,0:00:29.680
play the trailer of a movie.

0:00:29.680,0:00:30.720
So essentially,

0:00:30.720,0:00:35.540
what we want to do is run a line of[br]code like this: avatar.show_trailer().

0:00:35.540,0:00:39.840
And when that runs, we want it to[br]play the trailer of the movie Avatar.

0:00:39.840,0:00:44.070
By the way, a function that[br]is defined inside a class and

0:00:44.070,0:00:48.230
is associated with an instance[br]is called an instance method.

0:00:48.230,0:00:51.200
That is another new word for our list.

0:00:51.200,0:00:53.710
More on these new vocabulary words soon.

0:00:53.710,0:00:56.120
First, lets define show_trailer().
