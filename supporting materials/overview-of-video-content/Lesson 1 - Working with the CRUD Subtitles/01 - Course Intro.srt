Hi, my name is Lorenzo, and[br]I'll be your instructor as we

0:00:03.050,0:00:05.780
explore the foundations of[br]full stack web development.

0:00:05.780,0:00:09.010
In this course you will learn to build[br]your own data-driven web application,

0:00:09.010,0:00:10.630
but what does that actually mean?

0:00:10.630,0:00:14.260
Well, when I say web application[br]I'm referring to a web page or

0:00:14.260,0:00:17.890
collection of pages that allows your[br]browser to respond to user input,

0:00:17.890,0:00:20.608
similar to an offline[br]software application.

0:00:20.608,0:00:23.160
And by data-driven,[br]I mean an application that can store and

0:00:23.160,0:00:27.890
retrieve information from a database to[br]deliver customized content to the user.

0:00:27.890,0:00:31.140
Almost all of the popular websites[br]you interact with on a daily basis

0:00:31.140,0:00:33.080
are data-driven web applications.

0:00:33.080,0:00:35.660
Soon you will create a similar[br]website of your own.

0:00:35.660,0:00:38.700
In addition to creating web pages, you[br]will also learn to send data from your

0:00:38.700,0:00:41.150
server in other forms,[br]like JSON requests.

0:00:41.150,0:00:44.010
So that the data from your application[br]can be shared with other machines that

0:00:44.010,0:00:47.660
process JSON, like a data aggregator or[br]a mobile device.

0:00:47.660,0:00:50.463
Your mission in this course is[br]to help me create a menu app.

0:00:50.463,0:00:53.805
You'll be building an interactive[br]web application that presents a user

0:00:53.805,0:00:57.920
a variety of menu items they can view,[br]create, modify, and delete.

0:00:57.920,0:01:00.770
In the first lesson of this course[br]you will extract data from a database

0:01:00.770,0:01:02.295
using Python.

0:01:02.295,0:01:05.209
We'll also be using a tool called[br]an object-relational mapping, or

0:01:05.209,0:01:08.720
ORM to manipulate queries[br]as objects in Python.

0:01:08.720,0:01:10.860
If you've never heard of an ORM,[br]don't worry.

0:01:10.860,0:01:12.730
You'll be very familiar with[br]it in just a few minutes.

0:01:13.860,0:01:17.640
In the second lesson you will build[br]your first data-driven web application

0:01:17.640,0:01:20.330
using only the libraries that[br]come installed with Python.

0:01:20.330,0:01:22.790
In the third lesson we will[br]talk about frameworks and

0:01:22.790,0:01:26.220
create an application using[br]the lightweight web framework, Flask.

0:01:26.220,0:01:30.020
You will understand how frameworks help[br]developers write code more efficiently.

0:01:30.020,0:01:32.945
Once you complete this course you[br]will easily be able to compare and

0:01:32.945,0:01:36.140
contrast frameworks, and choose one[br]of your own for future projects.

0:01:36.140,0:01:38.918
Finally, you'll use what you[br]learned from lessons one, two, and

0:01:38.918,0:01:42.420
three to iteratively write code until[br]you have a polished menu application,

0:01:42.420,0:01:45.300
complete with API endpoints for[br]JSON requests.

0:01:45.300,0:01:45.910
Let's get started.
