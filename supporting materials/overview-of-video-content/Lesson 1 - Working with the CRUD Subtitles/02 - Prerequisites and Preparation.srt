Before we get started, let's discuss[br]some of the necessary technologies you

0:00:03.870,0:00:07.020
should be familiar with in order to[br]get the most out of this course.

0:00:07.020,0:00:10.910
Most importantly, you should have[br]a basic understanding of Python coding.

0:00:10.910,0:00:14.050
If you're comfortable creating classes,[br]writing methods, and

0:00:14.050,0:00:16.930
understand inheritance,[br]you are in good shape for this course.

0:00:16.930,0:00:21.310
Knowledge of SQL statements such as[br]insert into, select, update, and

0:00:21.310,0:00:23.680
delete will also be a useful[br]skill in this course.

0:00:23.680,0:00:26.460
I will also assume you're[br]very comfortable reading and

0:00:26.460,0:00:28.050
writing HTML code.

0:00:28.050,0:00:31.880
CSS and JavaScript won't be necessary[br]to complete the activities, but

0:00:31.880,0:00:35.210
are helpful for creating a polished,[br]presentable final project.

0:00:35.210,0:00:37.320
Knowing your way around[br]the Unix command line and

0:00:37.320,0:00:40.940
being able to navigate through the file[br]system is also going to come in handy.

0:00:40.940,0:00:44.110
If you are unfamiliar or would like[br]to brush up on any of these topics,

0:00:44.110,0:00:47.330
please refer to the instructor notes for[br]some helpful links to classes and

0:00:47.330,0:00:48.640
other references.

0:00:48.640,0:00:50.030
For ease of configuration, and

0:00:50.030,0:00:54.120
installation, I strongly recommend using[br]a Vagrant machine for this course.

0:00:54.120,0:00:57.230
Vagrant allows you to create a virtual[br]machine on your computer so that you can

0:00:57.230,0:01:00.750
program without worrying about affecting[br]your computer's current configuration.

0:01:00.750,0:01:04.280
I have provided you a Vagrant file[br]with all of the necessary software

0:01:04.280,0:01:05.489
already installed.

0:01:05.489,0:01:08.990
A link to installing this Vagrant file[br]is provided in the instructor notes.

0:01:08.990,0:01:12.940
Once you successfully run vagrant up and[br]vagrant ssh, you're ready to keep going.
