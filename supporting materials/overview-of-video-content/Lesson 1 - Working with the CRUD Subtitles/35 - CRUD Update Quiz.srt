Rebecca just moved to a new house so

0:00:01.930,0:00:04.210
let's update her address[br]in the database.

0:00:04.210,0:00:06.240
Here, we find Rebecca in[br]the employee database,

0:00:06.240,0:00:09.610
assuming she's the only[br]Rebecca Allen in our employee table.

0:00:09.610,0:00:13.600
Next, we find her address[br]by matching rebecca.id to

0:00:13.600,0:00:16.309
the employee id in the address database.

0:00:16.309,0:00:20.880
Then, we set the street property of[br]her address to 281 Summer Circle.

0:00:20.880,0:00:23.890
We also update her zipcode to 00189.

0:00:23.890,0:00:27.180
Now, what do we add to our[br]session before we commit so

0:00:27.180,0:00:28.490
that this update takes place?
