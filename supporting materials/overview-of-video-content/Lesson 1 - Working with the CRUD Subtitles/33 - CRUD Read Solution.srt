Whenever we want to find[br]some information in

0:00:01.800,0:00:05.790
our database using SQLAlchemy,[br]we use the query command followed by

0:00:05.790,0:00:08.610
the name of the table that[br]we want to search through.

0:00:08.610,0:00:10.040
Using this enhanced for loop,

0:00:10.040,0:00:13.318
we declared employee as the variable[br]that we're going to iterate through.

0:00:13.318,0:00:16.720
So, printing employee.name will print[br]out the name of every employee in

0:00:16.720,0:00:17.240
our database.
