0:00:00.110,0:00:03.360
Going back to our employee example, fill[br]in the blanks to make a variable called

0:00:03.360,0:00:06.070
employees, which stores all[br]the employees in our database.

0:00:06.070,0:00:08.960
And then, iterate over this collection[br]to print the name of every employee.
