Clients and servers can be most[br]simply understood as computers

0:00:03.090,0:00:04.900
communicating across the Internet.

0:00:04.900,0:00:08.750
We define the client as the computer[br]that wants information, and the server

0:00:08.750,0:00:12.160
as the computer that has information[br]that can be shared with clients.

0:00:12.160,0:00:15.600
This means that a client has to initiate[br]communication to request information,

0:00:15.600,0:00:18.690
while the server constantly stays[br]listening for any clients to communicate

0:00:18.690,0:00:22.130
with it, and responds with the data[br]that the client requested.

0:00:22.130,0:00:25.190
Let's briefly discuss some of the[br]important concepts in order to better

0:00:25.190,0:00:27.500
understand how this actually happens.

0:00:27.500,0:00:30.540
So we know that clients and servers[br]can communicate with each other, but

0:00:30.540,0:00:32.880
how do we know that they're all[br]speaking the same language?

0:00:32.880,0:00:36.660
Well, protocols are like the grammatical[br]rules that we use to make sure all

0:00:36.660,0:00:39.700
machines on the Internet[br]are communicating in the same way.

0:00:39.700,0:00:42.720
There are several protocols that[br]computers on the Internet adhere to.

0:00:42.720,0:00:46.390
The most common three[br]are the Transmission Protocol, or TCP,

0:00:46.390,0:00:52.780
the Internet Protocol, IP, and[br]the HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

0:00:52.780,0:00:56.410
The Transmission Control Protocol or[br]TCP enables information

0:00:56.410,0:01:00.100
to be broken into small packets and[br]sent between clients and servers.

0:01:00.100,0:01:03.570
If a packet is lost somewhere along the[br]way the sender and receiver have a way

0:01:03.570,0:01:07.842
of figuring out which of the packets is[br]missing and request that they be resent.

0:01:07.842,0:01:12.690
The counterpart to TCP is UDP, User[br]Datagram Protocol, which is good for

0:01:12.690,0:01:15.140
streaming content like music or video.

0:01:15.140,0:01:19.220
Similar to postal addresses, IP[br]addresses allow messages to be properly

0:01:19.220,0:01:21.310
routed to all participants[br]on the Internet.

0:01:21.310,0:01:24.540
For simplicity's sake, we can assume[br]that every device on the Internet gets

0:01:24.540,0:01:26.520
an IP address that is[br]either statically or

0:01:26.520,0:01:29.480
dynamically assigned by[br]the Internet service provider.

0:01:29.480,0:01:33.600
Here's the IP address of my laptop,[br]and here is the IP address for Google.

0:01:33.600,0:01:37.380
When I type google.com into my browser,[br]my computer first figures out the IP

0:01:37.380,0:01:42.120
address of Google by looking it up[br]in a Domain Name Server, or DNS.

0:01:42.120,0:01:47.510
Think of DNS as a big online phonebook[br]that finds theIP address of web URLs.

0:01:47.510,0:01:51.410
Once DNS gives my computer the IP[br]address, it uses that address to

0:01:51.410,0:01:54.530
initiate communication with[br]the server for Google.

0:01:54.530,0:01:58.030
Since multiple applications using[br]the Internet can run on one machine,

0:01:58.030,0:02:01.280
operating systems use ports to[br]designate channels of communication

0:02:01.280,0:02:02.880
on the same IP address.

0:02:02.880,0:02:06.590
Placing a colon after an IP address,[br]with another number indicates that we

0:02:06.590,0:02:11.200
want to communicate on a specific port[br]on the device using that IP address.

0:02:11.200,0:02:16.609
On most machines,[br]port numbers can range from 0 to 65,536.

0:02:16.609,0:02:20.641
The first 10,000 ports are often times[br]reserved by the operating system for

0:02:20.641,0:02:22.050
a specific use.

0:02:22.050,0:02:24.640
Port 80 is the most common port for[br]web servers.

0:02:24.640,0:02:27.780
So most websites we use every day[br]are hitting port 80 when they

0:02:27.780,0:02:28.370
reach a server.

0:02:28.370,0:02:32.090
8080 is also a common port for[br]web communications.

0:02:32.090,0:02:35.170
When client and server applications[br]are on the same machine

0:02:35.170,0:02:37.800
we indicate this with[br]the term localhost.

0:02:37.800,0:02:43.629
Localhost also has a special[br]IP address of 127.0.0.1.

0:02:43.629,0:02:47.195
Whenever we type localhost, or this[br]special IP address into a browser or

0:02:47.195,0:02:50.000
web application,[br]the operating system knows to look for

0:02:50.000,0:02:52.640
this resource locally and[br]not go out to the Internet.
