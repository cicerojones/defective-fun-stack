I save my code, stop and start my server[br]again, and visit the slash hello page.

0:00:05.140,0:00:06.080
And look.

0:00:06.080,0:00:08.160
Now my server responds to my input, so

0:00:08.160,0:00:10.790
I can make it say hello[br]in any language I'd like.

0:00:10.790,0:00:12.980
Get this server up and[br]running on your machine.

0:00:12.980,0:00:15.180
Feel free to use the code in[br]the instructor notes as reference.
