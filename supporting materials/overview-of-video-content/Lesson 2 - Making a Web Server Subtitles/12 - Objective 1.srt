In this next video,[br]I will implement objective one,

0:00:02.930,0:00:05.689
creating a web page that lists all[br]the restaurants in the database when

0:00:05.689,0:00:08.664
the user visits localhost[br]port 8080/restaurants.

0:00:08.664,0:00:11.980
Once you've attempted this challenge,[br]proceed to the solution video.
