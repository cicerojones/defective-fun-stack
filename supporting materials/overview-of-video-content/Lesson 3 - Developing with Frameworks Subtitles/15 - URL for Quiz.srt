URL building is a helpful feature[br]in Flask to create URLs based on

0:00:04.370,0:00:05.870
the functions they execute.

0:00:05.870,0:00:09.240
This is really helpful when you want[br]to create links to other pages inside

0:00:09.240,0:00:10.300
your application.

0:00:10.300,0:00:14.440
To build a URL to a specific function,[br]we can use this url_for() method.

0:00:14.440,0:00:17.760
This is one of the many helper functions[br]that Flask makes available to us.

0:00:17.760,0:00:18.835
The documentation for

0:00:18.835,0:00:22.890
url_for() can be found on[br]the Flask documentation page here.

0:00:22.890,0:00:25.520
I want you to open up[br]the menu.html template and

0:00:25.520,0:00:28.780
add some new hyperlinks to edit and[br]delete each menu item.

0:00:28.780,0:00:32.970
Remember that this URL for helper method[br]returns a complete URL stream, so

0:00:32.970,0:00:35.410
place it where it belongs[br]inside of an anchor tag.

0:00:35.410,0:00:40.140
If your code works you should have edit[br]and delete links now on every menu item.

0:00:40.140,0:00:42.000
Read through the documentation for[br]reference.

0:00:42.000,0:00:44.080
Consult your fellow students[br]if you have any questions.
