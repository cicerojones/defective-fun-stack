So, in order to add our second JSON[br]endpoint, we should add a route,

0:00:03.240,0:00:04.920
just like specified in the question.

0:00:04.920,0:00:06.280
Then we create a new function.

0:00:06.280,0:00:10.575
I decided to call it menuItemJSON,[br]that passes in the restaurant_id and

0:00:10.575,0:00:13.060
menu_id, since both of them[br]are specified in the URL.

0:00:13.060,0:00:16.465
I'll then perform a query to[br]get the one menu ID that I

0:00:16.465,0:00:18.010
want to get the information about.

0:00:18.010,0:00:21.780
I will JSONify that menu item,[br]but serializing it first.

0:00:21.780,0:00:23.800
You can see a copy of this[br]code in the instructor notes.
