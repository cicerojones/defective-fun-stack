Inside my editMenuItem function,

0:00:02.120,0:00:05.775
I see that in my render_template,[br]I'm passing in three variables that my

0:00:05.775,0:00:08.710
editmenuitem.html file is[br]going to have access to.

0:00:08.710,0:00:11.270
The restaurant_id, the menu_id, and

0:00:11.270,0:00:13.880
i, which is going to represent[br]the item we want to edit.

0:00:13.880,0:00:15.450
So to edit a new menu item,

0:00:15.450,0:00:19.160
I'm going to create a form, just like[br]I did when I created a new menu item.

0:00:19.160,0:00:22.150
Inside the form I'm going to[br]call my edit menu item function

0:00:22.150,0:00:24.060
with the appropriate parameters.

0:00:24.060,0:00:27.990
Here I'll prompt for the name of the new[br]menu item and create an input field.

0:00:27.990,0:00:32.310
Using the placeholder attribute of HTML[br]I can have that field already filled out

0:00:32.310,0:00:34.670
with the name of the item[br]I'm going to edit.

0:00:34.670,0:00:36.390
I'll then add a button called Edit.

0:00:36.390,0:00:39.552
And here I create another link to[br]cancel just in case I realize I

0:00:39.552,0:00:41.770
actually don't want to[br]edit my menu item.

0:00:41.770,0:00:45.450
When I save and run, I see that I can[br]now change the name of my menu items.

0:00:45.450,0:00:48.040
The solution code for this video is[br]available in the instructor notes
