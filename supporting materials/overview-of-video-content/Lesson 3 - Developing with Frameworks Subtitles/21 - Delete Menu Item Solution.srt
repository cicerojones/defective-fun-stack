The first thing I'll modify in my[br]project.py file is this app.route,

0:00:04.300,0:00:07.030
such that we can respond to GET and[br]POST requests.

0:00:07.030,0:00:10.220
Similarly to when I edited a menu[br]item the next thing I'll do

0:00:10.220,0:00:11.990
is find the item I want to delete.

0:00:11.990,0:00:15.180
In my if statement I'll check again[br]to see if it's a POST request,

0:00:15.180,0:00:18.000
delete the item, and[br]redirect back to my main menu.

0:00:18.000,0:00:19.790
And if it's a GET request,[br]I'll go ahead and

0:00:19.790,0:00:23.670
render that deleteMenuItem.html file[br]with the item I want to delete.

0:00:23.670,0:00:25.990
Solutions for this challenge[br]are available in the Instructor Notes.
