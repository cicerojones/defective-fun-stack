0:00:00.140,0:00:01.780
Now, it's your turn to make a form and[br]Flask.

0:00:01.780,0:00:03.455
Create a template called,

0:00:03.455,0:00:07.755
editMenuItem.html that allows me to[br]edit the name, of a specific menu item.

0:00:07.755,0:00:09.850
A major difference between this form,[br]and

0:00:09.850,0:00:12.500
the new menu form is that now[br]you should find the menu item,

0:00:12.500,0:00:16.140
you want to edit, and pass that in[br]with the render template function.

0:00:16.140,0:00:17.510
Use the placeholder tag in HTML,

0:00:17.510,0:00:21.230
so that the user sees the information[br]that they're about to modify.

0:00:21.230,0:00:25.290
Also, add a link called, Cancel that[br]will take me back to the main menu page,

0:00:25.290,0:00:27.590
if I decide I don't want to[br]modify a menu item.

0:00:27.590,0:00:31.080
In the instructor notes, you'll find[br]a project.py file that already has

0:00:31.080,0:00:33.290
the editMenuItem function filled out, so

0:00:33.290,0:00:35.590
you just need to create the form[br]that will communicate with it.
