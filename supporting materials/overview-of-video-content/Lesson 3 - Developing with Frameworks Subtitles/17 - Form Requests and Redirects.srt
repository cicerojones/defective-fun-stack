We know that with HTTP,

0:00:01.220,0:00:04.730
there are various types of requests[br]that we can send along with URL.

0:00:04.730,0:00:07.850
By default a route in Flask[br]only answers to get requests.

0:00:07.850,0:00:10.970
But that can be changed by providing[br]the methods argument inside

0:00:10.970,0:00:11.810
the route decorator.

0:00:11.810,0:00:14.480
I will change my route to[br]create a new menu item.

0:00:14.480,0:00:17.000
Such as a response to GET and[br]POST requests like so.

0:00:17.000,0:00:20.830
Now that I can respond to POST requests,[br]I can make forms for creating and

0:00:20.830,0:00:22.290
updating menu items.

0:00:22.290,0:00:26.100
I will make a new template[br]called newMenuItem.html like so.

0:00:26.100,0:00:28.040
Take a second to look over the code.

0:00:28.040,0:00:31.290
Here, I'm making a small form with[br]only one entry to create a new

0:00:31.290,0:00:32.780
menu item name.

0:00:32.780,0:00:35.990
In order to get data from a form,[br]I will input requests from my

0:00:35.990,0:00:39.300
Flask package like so,[br]inside my project.py file.

0:00:39.300,0:00:42.940
Inside my new menu item function, I will[br]create an if statement that looks for

0:00:42.940,0:00:44.030
a POST request.

0:00:44.030,0:00:46.000
I can create a new menu item like so.

0:00:46.000,0:00:49.640
And extract the name field from[br]my form using the request.form.

0:00:49.640,0:00:52.840
After I create the menu item,[br]I can then add it to my session and

0:00:52.840,0:00:54.520
commit the session to the database.

0:00:54.520,0:00:57.510
To redirect the user back to the main[br]user page I can use a helper

0:00:57.510,0:00:59.920
function called redirect like so.

0:00:59.920,0:01:01.745
I should remember to import redirect,[br]and

0:01:01.745,0:01:05.150
url_for, in order to enable this[br]functionality in my project.

0:01:05.150,0:01:08.820
Now, I need to properly handle the get[br]request, for creating a new menu item.

0:01:08.820,0:01:11.680
If my server didn't receive a POST[br]request, it's going to go ahead and

0:01:11.680,0:01:14.480
render the template, for[br]the new HTML template that I created,

0:01:14.480,0:01:17.740
to create a new menu item,[br]passing in the restaurant_id as well.

0:01:17.740,0:01:21.030
Now when I click create new item it[br]takes me to the New Menu Item page and

0:01:21.030,0:01:23.490
I have successfully[br]created a new menu item
