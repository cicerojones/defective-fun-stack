I've created a simple template here,[br]and called it menu.html.

0:00:02.760,0:00:05.890
A copy of it,[br]is available in the instructor notes.

0:00:05.890,0:00:06.720
Take a look at it, and

0:00:06.720,0:00:09.890
see if you can figure out,[br]how Flask accommodates for escape code?

0:00:09.890,0:00:12.920
You should see a few symbols here,[br]that don't look like HTML.

0:00:12.920,0:00:15.230
Try and see if you can figure out,[br]what each one of them does.
