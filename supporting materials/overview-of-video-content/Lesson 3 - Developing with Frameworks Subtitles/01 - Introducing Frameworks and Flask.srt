0:00:00.390,0:00:03.650
So up to this point, we've created[br]our code almost purely from scratch,

0:00:03.650,0:00:06.939
using a few internal libraries[br]like HTTP Base Server and

0:00:06.939,0:00:09.750
external libraries like SQL Alchemy.

0:00:09.750,0:00:12.540
Creating a website from scratch really[br]shows that you have a good grasp of

0:00:12.540,0:00:16.800
underlying programming concepts and[br]are able to utilize the power of Python.

0:00:16.800,0:00:17.990
But as we make our website more and

0:00:17.990,0:00:21.710
more complex, the code becomes[br]repetitive and difficult to maintain.

0:00:21.710,0:00:25.280
Frameworks are collections of code that[br]simplify the web development process.

0:00:25.280,0:00:27.070
They take care of repetitive tasks and

0:00:27.070,0:00:30.200
allow us to focus on the more[br]unique features of our project.

0:00:30.200,0:00:30.880
At the moment, some of

0:00:30.880,0:00:34.970
the most popular frameworks out there[br]are RubyonRails.net and Django.

0:00:34.970,0:00:37.970
But if we take a look at this Wikipedia[br]article, we see that there are hundreds

0:00:37.970,0:00:41.480
of frameworks developers have created to[br]code web applications more efficiently.

0:00:41.480,0:00:42.380
Frameworks may rise and

0:00:42.380,0:00:44.720
fall in popularity but[br]the same underlying concepts for

0:00:44.720,0:00:48.190
developing web pages applies for[br]all of these technologies.

0:00:48.190,0:00:51.070
Think of a framework as[br]a box of prepared cake mix.

0:00:51.070,0:00:53.570
We could make a cake using all[br]of these items from scratch and

0:00:53.570,0:00:56.540
would probably have a better[br]understanding of how to make cakes.

0:00:56.540,0:00:59.010
But if we have several cakes to[br]make in a short period of time,

0:00:59.010,0:01:01.920
finding a good cake mix simplifies[br]the preparation process and

0:01:01.920,0:01:03.640
helps us focus on other things.

0:01:03.640,0:01:04.190
Like frosting.

0:01:05.602,0:01:09.310
In lesson two you built a website with[br]the raw ingredients of web development.

0:01:09.310,0:01:10.100
Now it's time to see how we

0:01:10.100,0:01:12.230
can use frameworks to improve[br]our development process.
