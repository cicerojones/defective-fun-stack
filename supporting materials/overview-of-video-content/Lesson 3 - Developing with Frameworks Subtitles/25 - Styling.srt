So we have a working application now,[br]but

0:00:02.050,0:00:05.720
we should probably add some style to it,[br]if we want it to be appealing to users.

0:00:05.720,0:00:07.100
Flask can automatically look for

0:00:07.100,0:00:11.890
CSS, JavaScript, and media files,[br]if we put them in a folder named static.

0:00:11.890,0:00:13.780
So I will create a folder called static,

0:00:13.780,0:00:16.610
in the same directory as[br]my project.py file, as so.

0:00:16.610,0:00:18.910
I will create a CSS file, and

0:00:18.910,0:00:22.360
name it styles.css, and[br]store it inside of this directory.

0:00:22.360,0:00:24.660
By adding this following[br]link to my template files,

0:00:24.660,0:00:29.390
I will tell Flask to use this styles.css[br]file when it renders this template.

0:00:29.390,0:00:30.860
When I refresh my browser,

0:00:30.860,0:00:34.500
I turn my old unstyled menu page[br]into one that looks like this.

0:00:34.500,0:00:36.950
Take some time to add some[br]styles to your menu app.

0:00:36.950,0:00:40.270
My CSS file and templates can be found[br]in the instructor notes for reference.
