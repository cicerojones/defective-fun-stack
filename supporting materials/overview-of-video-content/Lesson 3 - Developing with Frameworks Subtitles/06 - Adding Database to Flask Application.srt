So now that we have[br]a functioning Flask application,

0:00:02.490,0:00:04.220
let's bring our CRUD[br]functionality into it.

0:00:04.220,0:00:06.720
I will import the code for[br]SQLAlchemy and

0:00:06.720,0:00:10.130
the database engine in sessionmaker[br]like in Lessons 1 and 2.

0:00:10.130,0:00:12.780
Now I'm going to change my[br]HelloWorld function such that it

0:00:12.780,0:00:16.720
performs this following query to grab[br]the first restaurant out of my database.

0:00:16.720,0:00:20.578
And list out all of the menu items and[br]stored in a string called output.

0:00:20.578,0:00:23.670
I'll also add a break line tag to[br]make my output a bit easier to read.

0:00:23.670,0:00:27.690
I will return this output string so[br]that my user sees it from the browser.

0:00:27.690,0:00:31.720
When I save my Python file my flask[br]server instantly refreshes itself.

0:00:31.720,0:00:34.840
So when I refresh the page I now[br]see all of my menu items listed
