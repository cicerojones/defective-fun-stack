In this lesson, you'll create a menu[br]app, using the Flask framework.

0:00:03.450,0:00:08.029
I will start by showing you the basic[br]components of a Flask application,

0:00:08.029,0:00:11.860
with a simple hello world program,[br]which you will then create on your own.

0:00:11.860,0:00:15.930
Then we will connect to our database via[br]SQL Alchemy to view all of the items in

0:00:15.930,0:00:16.640
each restaurant menu.

0:00:17.780,0:00:19.900
Next, you will learn about templates,[br]and

0:00:19.900,0:00:23.270
how they allow you to write HTML code,[br]separately from Python code.

0:00:23.270,0:00:24.670
Keeping your application more organized.

0:00:25.680,0:00:26.540
After that,

0:00:26.540,0:00:30.380
I will introduce a special function[br]in Flask called url_for, which builds

0:00:30.380,0:00:33.670
the URLs that you will use to navigate[br]through your new Flask application.

0:00:34.710,0:00:37.670
We will then create forms to[br]capture data from users, and

0:00:37.670,0:00:41.010
use message flashing to notify the user[br]each time they successfully change

0:00:41.010,0:00:42.000
information in the database.

0:00:42.000,0:00:45.360
I will discuss a way to use[br]flash to add the option to

0:00:45.360,0:00:48.310
send JSON messages instead of HTML.

0:00:48.310,0:00:51.310
And finally, take some time to[br]style our app with some CSS.
